Sure, Maria and I had a friendly conversation on 04/05/2023 in Ghent, Belgium. We discussed her dreams of traveling to Thailand, India, and Colombia, and shared some recommendations on what to see and do in each country. Maria also mentioned her love for her family and strategies for reducing discomfort from sitting for long periods. We agreed to stay in touch and support each other in our fitness routines. Overall, it was a positive and helpful conversation, and we both left feeling motivated and excited about the prospects of future travel.
